## âœ‹ About this project
This project is a mobile application developed on Android that translates words and sentences from Spanish into the Yoreme language. This project was completed over a period of 3 months with the help of linguists and native speakers of the language. 

The project captures Spanish words or utterances typed using the on-screen keyboard or the microphone of the mobile device. Once the information is captured, it is sent to call the database through a REST API, this API searches the database for the translation and returns it through a JOSN.

The application receives the JSON with the translation and a URL with the audio of the translation. The REST API and the audios are located on a web server.
